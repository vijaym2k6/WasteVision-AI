# WasteVision AI

**WasteVision AI** is an AI-powered computer vision system that automatically detects, classifies, and sorts different types of waste from images or video streams.  
Our mission is to make waste management smarter, reduce human effort, and support a sustainable future.
# I used Kaggle Notebook and trained the model there.
